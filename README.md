# WP3_UseCases

This repository includes a set of analytical notebooks that demonstrate **digital contract science**.

Digital contract science makes use of the digital contracts approach that the Open Trust Fabric community develops and combines data science methods in an attempt to provide insights on digital economy to policy makers and others interested.

The notebooks are implemented in Jupyter by following the literate programming approach that combines documentation, analysis code in Python, refined data, and visualizations that together enable actors with different backgrounds to come together to make sense of digital economy and different applications of digital contract science in it.

To run the all the notebooks, you have to set up the analytical infrastructure and access the source datasets. For Use Case 1, we provide a public dataset that allows running and extending the notebooks and invite you to join us in making sense of the platform economy around Airbnb.

## Setting up

We use Python <code>virtualenv</code> to manage the analytical environment for the three use cases.

Once you have cloned this repository, create a dedicated virtual environment for your local project:

  python3 -m venv env
